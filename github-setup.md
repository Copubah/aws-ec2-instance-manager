# GitHub Repository Setup

## Option 1: Using GitHub CLI (Recommended)

If you have GitHub CLI installed:

```bash
# Create repository on GitHub
gh repo create aws-ec2-instance-manager --public --description "Production-ready Go application for automated AWS EC2 instance management using tag-based filtering"

# Push to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aws-ec2-instance-manager.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 2: Using GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `aws-ec2-instance-manager`
3. Description: `Production-ready Go application for automated AWS EC2 instance management using tag-based filtering`
4. Set to Public
5. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

Then run these commands:

```bash
# Add remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aws-ec2-instance-manager.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 3: Using SSH (if you have SSH keys configured)

```bash
# Add remote origin with SSH
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/aws-ec2-instance-manager.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## After Creating the Repository

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Enable GitHub Pages (optional) - use main branch for documentation
3. Add repository topics: `aws`, `ec2`, `golang`, `automation`, `devops`, `infrastructure`
4. Add a repository description
5. Set up branch protection rules for main branch (optional but recommended)

## Repository Features to Enable

- Issues (for bug reports and feature requests)
- Discussions (for community questions)
- Wiki (for extended documentation)
- Security advisories
- Dependabot alerts

Your repository is now ready with:
- Production-ready Go code with best practices
- Comprehensive documentation
- Security policies and guidelines
- Modular architecture for easy extension
- Lambda deployment support
- Multi-platform build support
